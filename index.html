        <h2>SHORT BIO</h2>
        <p>
          Johann Sebastian Bach was bon in 1685, in Thuringia, in a family full
          of musicians.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bach was well-known by his contemporaries as an excellent
          harpsichordist, organist, and expert on organ building. But now is
          considered the GOAT of the composers.
        </p>
        <p>
          His beautiful compositions shows his profound Christianism. In all of
          the eclesiastic wok of Bach and in some of his non-church works he
          wrote the initials: "S.D.G." which stand for "Soli Deo Gloria", this
          is a Latin term for Glory to God alone.(1)
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most remarkable piece of music written by Bach is the "St
          Matthew Passion", which is described as one of the best piece of music
          of all times.
